Detecting Malicious Applications on Facebook using Machine Learning


Now a days, the existence of facebook, twitter or any other Online Social Networking Sites (OSNs) is a must in our daily lives. As it is way to stay connected
and communicate with our closed and distanced ones. The sites are used for various purposes such as music, pictures, videos downloading, posting various photos, details
etc. 

The addictiveness and craze of all these OSNs has increased due to the presence of the third party applications. However, the spammers have realised the potential of
these third party applications and are using it as a tool to disturb and spam user profiles. In many cases, according to a survey these applications are malicious. 

There are many ways a spammer can benefit from these mali-cious applications: (i) spammer can reach a large number of users. (ii) can spread spam. (iii) obtain userâ€™s personal
information, for example: email, phone no, gender, home city etc. (iv) with the help of single user spammer can spam other users too. As the research goes on, research
communities have focused on detecting malicious URLs and online social campaignswhich are fake or spam.

Here we develop an application, SecureU app, we help detect mailicious application, fake or spam messages, hide pictures and posts which are inapproriate and it will also help us to give real time notifications.
